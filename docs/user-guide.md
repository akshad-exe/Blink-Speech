# User Guide

This guide explains how to use Blink Speech effectively for assistive communication through eye blinks and gaze gestures.

## üéØ Getting Started

### What is Blink Speech?

Blink Speech is a web-based assistive communication tool that converts your eye movements into spoken words. By detecting blink patterns and gaze directions through your camera, it enables hands-free communication for people who cannot speak or type.

### Who Can Use This?

- **Medical patients**: ICU patients, post-surgery recovery, locked-in syndrome
- **People with disabilities**: ALS, muscular dystrophy, paralysis
- **Temporary conditions**: Speech loss from surgery, illness, or injury
- **Emergency situations**: When traditional communication methods fail

## üöÄ First Time Setup

### 1. Access the Application

1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
2. **Navigate to** the Blink Speech website or run it locally
3. **Ensure HTTPS** is enabled (required for camera access)

### 2. Camera Setup

1. **Position yourself** 18-24 inches from your camera
2. **Ensure good lighting** - face the light source, avoid backlighting
3. **Remove glasses** if they cause glare (optional but recommended)
4. **Sit upright** and keep your head relatively still

### 3. Grant Permissions

When prompted:
1. **Click "Allow"** for camera access
2. **Wait for initialization** (may take 10-30 seconds)
3. **Check video feed** appears correctly

## üéØ Calibration Process

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Calibration is essential for accurate gaze detection. Complete this carefully.

### Step-by-Step Calibration

1. **Start calibration** by clicking "Start Session" on the homepage
2. **Follow the dots**: Five dots will appear sequentially on screen
3. **Look directly at each dot** and click when you're focused on it
4. **Keep your head still** during the entire process
5. **Complete all five points** for optimal accuracy

### Calibration Tips

- **Take your time** - accuracy is more important than speed
- **Look precisely at the center** of each dot
- **Keep your distance consistent** throughout calibration
- **Recalibrate if needed** - you can repeat this process anytime

### Understanding Calibration Quality

- **Good calibration**: Gaze detection responds accurately to eye movements
- **Poor calibration**: Delayed or incorrect gaze direction detection
- **When to recalibrate**: If gaze detection becomes inaccurate over time

## üëÅÔ∏è Understanding Gesture Patterns

### Basic Blink Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Default Phrase |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Single Blink** | One quick blink | "Hello" |
| **Double Blink** | Two blinks within 400ms | "Yes" |
| **Triple Blink** | Three blinks within 700ms | "No" |
| **Long Blink** | Hold blink for 800ms+ | "Thank you" |

### Gaze Directions

| Direction | How to Perform |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Look Left** | Move eyes to the left |
| **Look Right** | Move eyes to the right |
| **Look Up** | Move eyes upward |
| **Look Down** | Move eyes downward |
| **Center** | Look straight ahead |

### Combined Gestures

Combine blinks with gaze for more phrases:

| Gesture | Default Phrase |
|---------|----------------|
| **Single Blink + Look Left** | "I need help" |
| **Single Blink + Look Right** | "I'm okay" |
| **Double Blink + Look Up** | "Water please" |
| **Double Blink + Look Down** | "I'm tired" |

## üéØ Performing Gestures Effectively

### Best Practices for Blinks

1. **Natural blinking**: Use your normal blink speed and intensity
2. **Deliberate patterns**: Make intentional, clear blink sequences
3. **Wait between patterns**: Allow 1-2 seconds between different gestures
4. **Avoid rapid blinking**: This may cause false detections

### Gaze Movement Tips

1. **Smooth movements**: Move eyes steadily, not quickly
2. **Clear directions**: Make distinct directional movements
3. **Return to center**: Look back to center between different directions
4. **Hold briefly**: Maintain gaze direction for 0.5-1 seconds

### Timing Guidelines

- **Blink detection window**: Patterns detected within 2 seconds
- **Double blink timing**: Within 400ms between blinks
- **Triple blink timing**: All three blinks within 700ms
- **Long blink duration**: Hold for at least 800ms

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Your Experience

### Editing Gesture Mappings

1. **Click the settings button** (‚öôÔ∏è) in the session interface
2. **Open "Customize Mappings"** section
3. **Select a gesture** from the dropdown
4. **Type your custom phrase** in the text field
5. **Save changes** - they're stored locally

### Example Custom Mappings

```
Single Blink ‚Üí "Hi there"
Double Blink ‚Üí "Yes, please"
Triple Blink ‚Üí "No, thank you"
