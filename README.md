# Blink Speech

> **Turning blinks and gaze into voice – communication without boundaries.**

Blink Speech is a revolutionary browser-based assistive communication application that transforms eye blink patterns and gaze gestures into spoken phrases using advanced computer vision and speech synthesis. Built with modern web technologies, it operates entirely client-side to ensure maximum privacy and accessibility.

## 🌍 **Vision & Impact**

### **Everyone Deserves a Voice**

Blink Speech was born from a simple yet powerful belief: **communication is a fundamental human right**. By transforming natural eye movements into spoken words, we're breaking down barriers that prevent people from expressing their thoughts, needs, and emotions.

### **Who We Help**

🏥 **Healthcare Patients**
- ICU patients who cannot speak due to intubation
- Post-surgery recovery when vocal communication is difficult
- Individuals with locked-in syndrome or severe paralysis
- Emergency communication when traditional methods fail

♿ **People with Disabilities**
- ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) patients as speech deteriorates
- Individuals with muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy
- Stroke survivors during speech therapy recovery
- Anyone with motor impairments affecting traditional communication

⏰ **Temporary Conditions**
- Recovery from oral or throat surgery
- Severe laryngitis or vocal cord issues
- Medication side effects affecting speech
- Fatigue-related communication difficulties

🌍 **Global Accessibility**
- Works in any language or cultural context
- No specialized hardware or expensive equipment required
- Runs on existing devices (computers, tablets, phones)
- Free and open-source for maximum accessibility
